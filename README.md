# Setup

The program was created using Intellij and Java SDK 11, so you might need to do the following in order to make the program work:

- Mark the "src"-folder as the "source"-folder
- Right-click on the "src"-folder, select the "Mark Directory as.." and finally select the (blue) "Source Root"
- Select Output-folder
  - Create a new folder within the project named "out"
  - Go to File -> Project Structure... -> Project Settings -> Project -> Project Compiler output and select your out-folder
  - Hit Apply
